The data files are:

	acraft basesx bednfmx netwrk4 patdatx sgenms

The first field in the file patdatx gives the number of days the problem
is to model.  Large number of days gives large problems.  We were told
that this is the only parameter to play with, so we know no more about
these files.

The output is stored in the files:
